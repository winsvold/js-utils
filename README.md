# Small utility-library in ts for reusable code in Biblioteksentralens frontend-apps

Very simple utility-library for usage in Biblioteksentralen. Feel free to use, but functionality might not work as expected outside Biblioteksentralen-context ðŸ¤·

Written in typescript.

React components are written for usage in Nextjs, and might rely upon nextjs to work properly. For example the link components uses 'next/link'.
